    <h1>Luna: The Cat</h1>
    <p>Luna is the second oldest dog I have. She is by far the weirdest one of the pack. She is very shy and cuddly at the same time. She loves stealing socks and sleeping! My family and I often describe her as a cat!</p>

    <h1>Chiquis: The Troublemaker</h1>
    <p>Chiquis is the last and youngest dog that I have. She is very energetic and playful! She is also the most mischievous. She loves ripping up toys and hiding underneath the bed. She's an angel once you get her exhausted from playing or walking!</p>
